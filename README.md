# What this is:

an app that lets me and mine keep track of the variety of media we own in an attempt to stop the "I don't think we
have this" then coming hoem to the 7 copies of it conversations I have more frequently than I should.

also I wanted to learn basic rust which I think I have or I am making all the rust devs tear their hair out, but either
way it runs it seems to works and persist data so win in my book 

## Why is this open on github?

Good question, mostly so that I can work on it across all of my many machines, But also when I want to actually deploy
this on anything I can do so with a single docker file, or I can just one button deploy to heroku if I so choose

### But why make it public?

Because I think that hording of knowledge is useless, so any thing I learn I share, also it makes me more aware of the 
many I don't want to share so it makes me more careful around secrets handling and also GitHub limits us non premium 
users to a set amount of private repos and I am going to save thoes for projects that I really don't want people seeing

#### To build
I just use cargo haven't tried to deploy yet when i do will add the steps i take here don't be surprised when this 
never changes.
